# ThreeDO Metadata Schema for 3D Objects at Illinois: Halle Burns, Edward Gloor, Garrett McComas, Daria Orlowska - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

This is the workspace for group project from UIUC iSchool Metadata course. Group members include: Edward Gloor (elgloor), Garrett McComas (mccomasg), Daria Orlowska (dorlow2), and Halle Burns (hburns2).

The ThreeDO Data Dictionary is a resource for implementing descriptive metadata for 3D objects. ThreeDO was created to increase searchability of three-dimensional objects created by University-affiliated personnel, which can be interacted with in virtual reality.

The schema is also meant to describe the technical aspects that will help in future preservation, but it is not specifically a schema for preservation metadata. Rather, the schema has been created to facilitate the searching of 3D objects so that they may be used by members of the University of Illinois community, and the communities of implementers of the schema.
